# Proxy Config Spring Boot Starter: Simplifying Proxy Configuration for Applications

## Introduction

In today's interconnected world, many applications need to communicate with external services over the internet. However, in corporate or secure environments, this communication often needs to go through a proxy server. A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your application and the internet, helping with security, monitoring, and compliance.

The Proxy Config Spring Boot Starter is a tool that makes it easy for developers to set up and use proxy servers in their applications. It is built for applications that use the Spring Boot framework, a popular platform for building Java-based applications. This article explains what this tool does, how it works, and why it is usefulâ€”even for those who may not have a technical background.

## Features

- System-wide proxy configuration
- Support for proxy authentication
- Non-proxy hosts configuration
- Ready-to-use RestTemplate with proxy settings

## What Is a Proxy Server?

Before diving into the tool, letâ€™s understand what a proxy server is in simple terms:

Imagine you want to send a letter to someone, but instead of sending it directly, you give it to a trusted middleman. This middleman checks the letter, ensures itâ€™s safe, and then forwards it to the recipient. Similarly, when your application sends or receives data over the internet, a proxy server acts as this middleman.

Proxies are often used in organizations to:

- Control access to certain websites or services.
- Monitor traffic for security purposes.
- Hide the identity of the application by masking its IP address.

## Why Do Applications Need Proxy Configuration?

Applications need to know how to communicate with a proxy server. This involves providing details like:

- **Proxy Address**: Where the proxy server is located (e.g., proxy.example.com).
- **Port Number**: The "door" through which the application communicates with the proxy (e.g., 8080).
- **Authentication**: If the proxy requires a username and password, the application needs to provide these credentials.

Manually setting up these configurations can be time-consuming and error-prone. Thatâ€™s where the Proxy Config Spring Boot Starter comes inâ€”it automates and simplifies this process.

## Installation

This starter is published to **GitHub Packages**.

Add the GitHub Packages repository and the dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <name>GitHub Packages</name>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/yokumar9780/proxy-config-spring-boot-starter</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>proxy-config-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

ðŸ’¡ Make sure to replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

## Configuration

Add the following properties to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
# Enable or disable proxy configuration
proxy.enabled=true
# Proxy host address
proxy.host=proxy.example.com
# Proxy port
proxy.port=8080
# Authentication credentials (optional)
proxy.username=proxyuser
proxy.password=proxypassword
# Non-proxy hosts (optional) - specify hosts that should bypass the proxy
proxy.non-proxy-hosts=localhost|127.0.0.1|*.example.com
```

Or in YAML format:

```yaml
proxy:
  enabled: true
  host: proxy.example.com
  port: 8080
  username: proxyuser
  password: proxypassword
  non-proxy-hosts: localhost|127.0.0.1|*.example.com
```

## Usage

Once you've added the starter to your project and configured the properties, the proxy settings will be automatically applied.

Inject the proxied RestTemplate into your service or component:

### Accessing the ProxyConfigurationService

You can autowire the `ProxyConfigurationService` to access its functionality:

```java
@Autowired
private RestTemplate restTemplate;

// Then use it as usual:
String result = proxiedRestTemplate.getForObject("https://example.com/api", String.class);
```

## How Does It Work?

The Proxy Config Spring Boot Starter works behind the scenes. Hereâ€™s a simple analogy:

Imagine youâ€™re setting up a new phone. Instead of manually entering all the settings for Wi-Fi, email, and apps, you use a setup wizard that asks you a few questions and configures everything for you. This tool is like that setup wizard for proxy servers in applications.

Hereâ€™s how it works step by step:

1. **Configuration**: You (or your IT team) provide the proxy details in a file called `application.yml` or `application.properties`. For example:

   ```yaml
   proxy:
     host: proxy.example.com
     port: 8080
     username: user
     password: pass
   ```

2. **Automatic Application**: The tool reads these settings and applies them to the application automatically.

3. **Ready-to-Use Components**: Developers can use the pre-configured tools (like RestTemplate) to connect to external services without worrying about the proxy.

## Why Is This Tool Useful?

This tool is beneficial for both technical and non-technical stakeholders:

### For Developers:

- Saves time by automating proxy setup.
- Reduces errors caused by manual configuration.
- Provides ready-to-use components, making development faster.

### For Businesses:

- Ensures compliance with IT policies by enforcing proxy usage.
- Improves security by routing all traffic through a controlled proxy server.
- Simplifies maintenance, as changes to proxy settings can be made in one place.

## Real-Life Example

Letâ€™s say your company has an application that fetches weather data from an external service. Without this tool, the developer would need to manually configure the proxy settings in multiple places in the code. If the proxy server changes, they would have to update the code again.

With the Proxy Config Spring Boot Starter:

1. The IT team provides the proxy details in the configuration file.
2. The tool automatically applies these settings.
3. The developer can focus on building features, like displaying the weather, without worrying about proxy setup.

## Release & Publish

To release a new version:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the starter to GitHub Packages.

## Building from Source

To build the project from source, you need:

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.0+
- Public GitHub repository

Run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Testing and Reliability

The tool includes built-in tests to ensure it works correctly. These tests simulate different scenarios, such as:

- What happens if the proxy is disabled?
- How does the tool handle incorrect proxy credentials?

This ensures the tool is reliable and works as expected in real-world situations.

## Conclusion

The Proxy Config Spring Boot Starter is a valuable tool for organizations that need to use proxy servers in their applications. It simplifies the setup process, reduces errors, and ensures compliance with IT policies. By automating proxy configuration, it allows developers to focus on building features while ensuring secure and efficient communication with external services.

Whether youâ€™re a developer or a business stakeholder, this tool helps save time, improve security, and make applications easier to manage.
